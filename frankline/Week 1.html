				<h2>Introduction to Version Control</h2>

					<p> In order to control the version of our project files we opted to work with github ,which meant I had to install<br>
					GIT Desktop application for easy manipulation and upload of the class files for review before being push to the main repo.</p>


				<h2>GIT Installation</h2>

				<h4>Step 1:</h4>


				<p> Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> platform suitable for your machine,on download completion  "Run" the installation File.</p>

				<p>On "Finish" Launch the GitHub Desktop Application.</p>


				<h2>Signing into Git Account.</h2>

				<h4>Step 2:</h4>

				<p>In order to Succesfully connect to your github account you need to sign with a registered GitHub user account else you need to SignUp on the Git page in order to complete step 2:  </p>

				<h2>Configuring Git and Adding Repos</h2>

				<h4>Step 3:</h4>

					<p>Following a Successful Login into the Git Account, ican now configure my repo files.<br>

					<br>Note:Internet connection is needed in order to sign into your Git Account and Add  New Repos that you may select.</p>

					<h3>NB:Incase you encounter a problem you can use the <a href="https://help.github.com/desktop/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop Documentation </a> else contact your supervisor for assistance with the configuration.</h3>

					<br>
					<br>
					<p>After minutes of staring at my Git app screen trying to figure out what the repositories option entailed i went back to the <a href="https://help.github.com/desktop/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop Documentation </a> hence; i realized the two manuals on the site served different task.The first gave guidance on Signing in and Configuring while the other illustrated how to Add and Clone Repos. </p>

				<h4>Step 4:</h4>

					<p>The process was a success and i was on the interface.Even before i could executed the final task the were 3 processes that i had to grasp in order to comfortably use the platform which were:

						<li>How to make a new branch</li>
						<li>How to make changes</li>

					
						<br> And Finally<br>
						<li>Opening a pull request</li>

					<p>I went through the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target="_blank">GitHub Flow Guide</a>which was educative though some terms slipped "Could it be that I was too sleepy"anyways the first thing I did was to Add my website into Github Desktop.</p>
