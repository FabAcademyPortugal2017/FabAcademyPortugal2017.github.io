                                Building a site is something i've never done or dare to do before, i have had to deal with some sort of programming but never something like this. So far, it has been a very steep learning curve but the tutorials, videos and classmates are 
                                giving a hand at getting over the top.

                                    <h3>Html and CSS</h3>
								
                                </header>
								<p>
								
                                    Logically i wasn't going to try to make the website from scratch so i went to search for one template i liked. Started with a simple one that ended up not being so simple with too many submenus, and the code for all was just too much. So i decided to search for a new one and i found this page that i believe that represents better my personal page.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    After a week and a half still not quite there with the simbiose between hmtl and css but i'll get there. It will be a week that will extend 
                                    throughout the course.

                                </header>
								<p>
									This wasn't the easiest task, my first instinct was to make a 3D printer for paste materials but after a while i realized that it wasn't going to be that challenging since there have been others who made something similar, so, i decided to change the idea a bit and though of a modular axis 3D printer, but once more i realized that is a well developed subject with a lot of diferent projects already made and i wouldn't had much more as well as it wouldn't give me much pleasure.
                                    <br>
                                    So, i came back to an idea i had before and already made. It was a gift i made for someone this last christmas but it was very simple and i couldn't developed much due to lack of time and experience, now i believe it's the right time for it and well end up being a very diverse project.
