                <li>3D printers are far from being plug-and-play devices. There is a lot of adjusting, and some of it seems like magic. I will highlight the most important points to consider in the settings of the Slic3r software, which works in conjunction with Repetier.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Still on <b>Repetier</b> in the "Slicer" tab the software presents us with several options of preset configuration. The first is the slicer software itself. On the drop-down menu, it is possible to choose from Slic3r, Cura, or older software that nobody uses...</li>
                    <li>In Print settings, we have characteristics of the particular model to print. My current choice is "coarsewithsupport"; later, I will discuss how I chose the settings that make up the presets presented.</li>
                    <li>Then we have "Printer Settings". Normally, settings related to a specific printer (machine) go here. In my presets, I have the different printers of the lab: one is a Cartesian printer, "Mini_2.5_retraction", and another (not shown) is a delta printer.</li>
                    <li>Here, in "Filament Settings", are the many filaments one can have, each with different settings like color, temperature, or thickness.</li>

                <ol>This <b>Slic3r</b> is the slicer software itself that is buried deep in the <b>Repetier</b>. Its realms are not for the faint of heart, where wrong moves here, or should I say settings, might render catastrophic results in your prints.
                    <li>As Slic3r presents in the first column, we have the classes: Print settings, Filament, and Printer.</li>
                    <li>Then, in the second column, we have drop-down menus to choose each preset that the user wishes to customize.</li>
                    <li>In the third column, we see a gear-shaped icon, a typical icon for configuration. Let's click on it to open each class and see its inner workings.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>Now we are in the Print Settings tab.
                    <li>Let's examine it sub-class by sub-class, starting with Layers and Perimeters.</li>
                    <li>In this area, we can see Layer height. This is an important setting that should not go beyond the nozzle diameter size. If you are in a hurry and don't care about the appearance, go high. I have chosen 0.3 mm for a rough feeling. The layers will be noticeable, and slopes will look like stairs. If you need a detailed result, go low. The limits of how low this can go are near infinite, but because time is limited, I suggest not going lower than 0.1 mm. A lower number means more layers, and it will be smooth as peach skin. </li>
                    <li>After each tweak, click on this strange blue square shape that reminds me of past times before all this excess of information and the echo chambers, before this true limitless universe of terabytes around us. It's called a floppy disk. If you don't click, believe me, you will regret it as nothing will be saved, but fear not, Slic3r won't let you do that without a warning.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="pic"> <img src="media/3d_scanning_and_printing/slic3r03.jpg">
                </p>
                <p>Now, this sub-class of the Print settings is infill. One can save a lot of time and money here. Someone once said they are both the same; frankly, I'd rather own the first than the second. The infill I have is 20%. I am not a cheapskate; I believe 20% is enough. After all, the ephemeral pieces this printer expels are rarely worth using all this corn. Ah, did I mention I am using PLA, a derivative of corn? Of course not; that's later in filaments... So, for now, believe me, 20% is enough for almost all prints. If you need to tow a truck, go crazy, use 100%. If, on the other hand, you want to make a delicate vase, 0% will leave you a hollow print.

                </p>
                <p>In this subsection of Print settings, the famous Skirt and Brim, the savvy fabber can use Brim instead of the ridiculous and wasteful rafts done by those who won't take the time to level and calibrate their printers. By using a wide brim, you make sure your print won't detach from the bed. Brim basically consists of lines next to each other and attached to the print; it's great for a spiky model's base, or just corners that want to take off from the print bed, causing "warping". The skirt is used to kind of clean one's noose—I mean nozzle, yes, the printer nozzle, the part that the filament comes out of. This setting will extrude a line around the model to be printed, especially useful when filament promiscuity is the case, so when changing colors or filament types, be sure to either extrude in the air or add some skirt before your print.</p>
                <p class="pic"> <img src="media/3d_scanning_and_printing/slic3r05.jpg">
                </p>
                <p>The subclass of Support material I leave for the people who won't challenge their machines for the ones who don't care to calibrate and level.</p>
                <p>With Support material, you use this for overhangs. Support builds under your model in places where the negative slope is too steep, in order to prevent a real bird's nest by free-forming under your nose—I mean nozzle.</p>
                <p>Raft... how I hate rafts! I don't even want to talk about rafts. I wonder how much popcorn has been erased from the universe by the usage of rafts! Well, like the name implies, no one wants to be on, or use, a raft. It's for emergencies and should be kept only for that. It creates a waste of material that will poorly compensate for the lack of leveling; it's for the lazy, but in the end, promotes more work, as the underside of the print will never be as smooth as the part printed directly on glass. Support also does that. Try printing with support and then spend the next hours post-processing your prints—super fun stuff.</p>
                <p class="pic"> <img src="media/3d_scanning_and_printing/slic3r06.jpg">
                </p>
                <p>The class of filament settings deserves not much time as they are straightforward. If your filament supplier cares about you, they will give you the temperature at which to print on a label on the sides of the box or spool. The diameter is, and has always been with me, 1.75mm. The thinner diameter is easier to push than 3mm, the other standard in filament thickness. After all, we are pushing filament through a nozzle with a 0.4 mm diameter; that's thin, so choosing a printer that takes a thin filament is better!</p>

                </p>
                <p>Here in printer settings, we find nozzle size. I use 0.4 mm. Next, my preferred setting in these tests—well, practically the only one I messed with—is "retraction".</p>
                <p>As the designer, engineer, and technician of my printers, there's little that I haven't tried before.</p>
                <p>The retraction, yes, the retraction, will depend on many factors. Too much retraction, and the filament can get stuck in the nozzle, guaranteeing one a lot of fun fixing/disassembling a nozzle where the filament froze in higher levels. It's always fun for geeks like me to fix that, NOT! Too little retraction, and you will have spider webs all around your towers. So, this is a setting that needs to be tested and tested, until, like many other settings, you do trial and error until mastered to what resembles perfection, if that even exists in FDM, of course.</p>

                <li> The prints were not bad, but there was a lot of oozing (spider webs). So, I increased the retraction by .5 mm and then by 1 mm; the improvements were very noticeable in both printers.

                <p>This design is either too hard or even impossible to do with subtractive techniques due to its shape and details, which are inaccessible to a 2-axis CNC or even a 3-axis one.</p>

                        <li>I started by selecting the slicer software. I chose "Slic3r" (with a 3 instead of the letter "E"—yes, this is a confusing name).</li>
                        <li>Next, I selected the pre-configured setting "coarse with support".</li>
                        <li>Then, the best option according to the previous tests: Mini 2.5 retraction.</li>
                        <li>On Extruder, there is only one pre-configured in this printer, so no choices are available.</li>
                        <li>Advanced configurations are available in the "configuration" option, but in my case, it was not needed as the already tested pre-configuration should work fine.</li>
                        <li>Finally, click on "Slice with Slic3r" to start the slicing process.</li>

                <li>Now the model is ready to be printed. This can be done by clicking on the button "Print". The top arrow points to the statistics of the print; it would take 1:41 minutes to print the scanned model, which I chose not to do. In the lower arrow, it's possible to see the support material that was prepared for the print.
